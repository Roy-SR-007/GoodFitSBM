\title{Computation of the chi-square test statistic for goodness-of-fit under beta SBM}
\usage{
graphchi(G, C, p_mle)
}
\arguments{
\item{G}{an igraph object which is an undirected graph with no self loop}

\item{C}{a positive integer vector of size n for block assignments of each node; from 1 to K (no of blocks)}

\item{p_mle}{a matrix with the MLE estimates of the edge probabilities}
}
\value{
A numeric value
\item{teststat_val}{The value of the chi-square test statistic}
}
\description{
\code{graphchi} obtains the value of the chi-square test statistic required for the goodness-of-fit of a beta SBM (Karwa et al. (2023))

# We model a network with 3 even classes

# Generate the matrix of connection probabilities

# Creating the n x n adjacency matrix
adj <- matrix(0, n, n)
for (i in 2:n) {
  for (j in 1:(i - 1)) {
    p = pmat[class[i], class[j]] # We find the probability of connection with the weights
    adj[i, j] = rbinom(1, 1, p) # We include the edge with probability p
  }

# graph from the adjacency matrix
