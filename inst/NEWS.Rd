\section{Version 0.0.1}{\itemize{
\item This version of the \emph{GoodFitSBM} package deals with \emph{goodness-of-fit} test for a \emph{ER-SBM} as well as \emph{beta-SBM} (two of the three variants of SBMs discussed in \emph{Karwa et al. (2023)} [\url{https://doi.org/10.1093/jrsssb/qkad084}] used for modelling network data.
\item \code{zachary} is the classic \emph{Zachary's Karate club data}, on which the goodness-of-fit test under a beta SBM framework is implemented.
\item This version also handles unknown block assignments of the network (graph) by estimating those through \emph{regularized spectral clustering} \emph{Qin and Rohe (2013)} [\url{https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/0ed9422357395a0d4879191c66f4faa2-Paper.pdf}].
